## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Oberleutnant20/swt2bib/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Oberleutnant20/swt2bib/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible,  demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use? Than meet us on our Teamspeak 3(ts3server://ts3.unique-players.de?port=9987&addbookmark=Unique-Players.de) or in our [Forum](https://unique-players.de).

#### **Coding conventions**

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  
  * We use HAML for all views
  
  * We avoid logic in views, putting HTML generators into helpers
  
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks!
